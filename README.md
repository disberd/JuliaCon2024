> [!NOTE]
> I unfortunately greatly miscalculated my presentation time, and was not able to show the use of PlutoVSCodeDebugger.jl
> Luckily enough, the documentation of PlutoVSCodeDebugger has nice video examples on how it can be used:
> - [github page](https://github.com/disberd/PlutoVSCodeDebugger.jl)
> - [Package Documentation](https://disberd.github.io/PlutoVSCodeDebugger.jl/stable/)
